# Privacy Policy for Egg Inventory

**Effective Date:** January 1, 2025

**Last Updated:** January 1, 2025

## Overview

Egg Inventory ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application.

## Information Collection and Use

**We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information.**

The App is designed with privacy as a core principle. All data you enter into the App is stored locally on your device only.

## Data Storage

All information you enter into Egg Inventory, including:
- Egg collection data
- Inventory counts
- Flock head counts
- Packaging information
- Sales records
- Customer names
- Pricing information
- Theme preferences

...is stored exclusively on your device using local storage (AsyncStorage). This data:
- Never leaves your device
- Is not transmitted to any servers
- Is not shared with any third parties
- Is not accessible to the app developer
- Is not backed up to any cloud service by the app

## Third-Party Services

The App does not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services.

## Data Access

Only you have access to your data. The app developer cannot access, view, or retrieve any information you enter into the App.

## Data Deletion

To delete all your data:
1. Open the App
2. Go to Settings
3. Scroll to the bottom
4. Tap "Clear All Data"
5. Type "delete" to confirm

Alternatively, uninstalling the App will remove all locally stored data from your device.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect information from children. Since we don't collect any data at all, the App is safe for users of all ages.

## Permissions

The App may request the following permissions:

**Photo Library Access (iOS)**
- Used only to save egg carton labels to your photo library
- Only activated when you choose to save a label
- You can deny this permission and the App will still function (you just won't be able to save labels)

**No other permissions are requested or required.**

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted:
- In this document
- On our support website
- In the App Store listing

Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device:
- Your data security depends on your device security
- We recommend using device-level security features (passcode, biometric authentication)
- Back up your device regularly if you want to preserve your data

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:
- **Access:** All your data is visible within the App
- **Modification:** You can edit or update any information
- **Deletion:** You can clear all data at any time
- **Portability:** Your data never leaves your device, so it's always with you
