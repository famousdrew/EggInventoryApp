### Version 2: Story-Driven (2,956 characters)

**Egg Inventory** was born from real farm experience. Tired of juggling notebooks, spreadsheets, and scraps of paper to track egg collections and sales? We were too.

**YOUR DAILY FARM COMPANION**

Start your morning with a quick egg count. Collecting from multiple species? Toggle between chickens, ducks, quail, turkeys, and guinea fowl with a tap. Want detailed records? Switch to Color Tracking mode to log every shade from your diverse flock‚Äîwhite, cream, light brown, chocolate, blue, green, pink, and speckled eggs.

Track your flock sizes so you know exactly how productive each species is performing.

**PACKAGE WITH CONFIDENCE**

Ready to package for market? Quick-pack buttons make it effortless:

Grab six chicken eggs? Tap "6" and you've created a carton. Collecting duck eggs? Package them in 4s, 6s, 8s, or 12s‚Äîwhatever your customers prefer. Each species has carton sizes that make sense for that bird.

Everything is tracked automatically. Your loose egg inventory decreases, and your "Ready to Sell" cartons increase. No mental math required.

**SELL SMARTER**

At the farmers market, record sales in seconds. Tap a carton, enter the customer's name, confirm the price (auto-calculated based on your settings), and done. Selling multiple cartons to one customer? Select them all and record a bundled sale.

Every transaction is saved with the date, customer name, and price. Need to know who bought eggs last month? It's all there.

**UNDERSTAND YOUR FARM**

The analytics show you what matters:
‚Ä¢ How many eggs are in inventory right now
‚Ä¢ How many cartons are packaged and ready
‚Ä¢ Total revenue from all sales
‚Ä¢ Average price per carton
‚Ä¢ Complete sales history

Make informed decisions about your flock and pricing.

**WORKS EVERYWHERE**

Designed for farm life, where cell service is spotty and WiFi doesn't reach the coop. Everything works offline. No account signup. No subscription. No cloud requirements. Just open the app and work.

Your data stays on your device. We can't see it, we don't want it, and we'll never sell it.

**LOOKS BEAUTIFUL, WORKS HARD**

Choose from 14 gorgeous themes‚Äîfrom soft Pink Autumn to rustic browns to coastal teals. Light and dark modes for every theme. Each one is tested for readability in bright sunlight and dim barns.

**BUILT FOR REAL FARMERS**

**NO LEARNING CURVE**

If you can count eggs, you can use this app. Intuitive design means you'll be productive in minutes, not hours.
